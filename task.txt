TASK:
We are set to build an online app, that fetches and shows Game data from Bundesliga. 

WORKFLOW:
A basic page will be built. It will fetch info from our current database for current match, if any, and will display it in relevant area. 
If visitor uses the search form, page will reload with the results, displayed as links, which will lead visitor to "game details data". 

IMPLEMENTATIONS:
First we will build a service, that will fetch data, thru BL API and will fill it in our database. Service will be written in PHP and is supposed to be ran from crontab. 
Second we will implement a search engine, that will works on two passes:
Pass 1: Will search in our database
if not result
Pass 2: Will call BL API to get needed result. 
On pass two, a second step, invisible for visitor will be implemented - store new data into database. 

Search in our database will perform query search (possible binary search, in case data volume grows big) on several columns of the game-data-table. In this case we will achieve a google-like search engine. 


TECHNOLOGIES:
MySQL - database server
XSLT/XML - templatiosation engine and XML also for fetching data from API site. Possible - JSON for fetching. 
PHP - my personal core engine, similar to frameworks, with internal ORM build on top of AdoDB. 
JavaScript/jQuery - for internal search

The choise to use these technologies is the fact, that I am advanced to them, they also has proven to be reliable, easymaintainable, with great performance, scalable.
